# Open Data Innovation Coursework 1
Data visualisation project using Covid Retention Scheme data. For producing visualisations, I have built a graph database using the dataset and used SPARQL for querying the graph database.

## Installation
1. Create a environment
2. Install requirements.txt into the .env file
3. Run the flask server and navigate to '/' route of the localhost:8000

## Check the live version
Application is live in https://rs7g15-coursework.herokuapp.com/. You can also check the turtle file, graph data format used, in https://rs7g15-coursework.herokuapp.com/api/file 

* Please note that it takes a small amount time for the server to wake up
